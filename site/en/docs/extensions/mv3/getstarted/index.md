Welcome to the Getting Started guides collection! The purpose of this page is to describe each article and how you can contribute to this collection.

## Begin your journey

The following articles will kick-start your Chrome extension development journey:

### Extension development concepts {: #concepts }

[Extensions 101][doc-ext-101]
: Briefly covers some fundamental concepts of Chrome Extension development like web technologies
used,  frequently used files, etc. It also highlights important guidelines to be aware of when
designing and distributing an extension in the Chrome Web Store. 

[Development Basics][doc-dev-basics]
: Introduces the extension development workflow by creating a "Hello, Extensions" example. It walks
through loading the extension during development, locating logs and errors, choosing a project
structure, and using Typescript.

### Beginner tutorials {: #tutorials }

The following step-by-step tutorials cover some common Chrome extension use-cases. In addition,
using these extensions will improve your experience with the extension documentation.

[Reading time][tut-reading-time]
: Itâ€™s nice to know how much time we need to spend reading an article. Reading time teaches you how
to insert an element containing the estimated reading time on every page.

[Focus Mode][tut-focus-mode]
: Removing extra clutter from a page allows our minds to concentrate on the most relevant
information. Focus Mode changes the style of the page to help you better digest the content of
extension documentation pages.

[Tabs Manager][tut-tabs-manager]
: Do you have multiple tabs on different windows? Tabs Manager uses an extension popup to display a
list of all the open extension documentation pages. It can also gather them all into one neat group. 

Each tutorial includes the following sections:

- What the extension does.
- What you will learn.
- What you need to know before starting.
- Step-by-step instructions. 
- How to load and test the extension.

In addition, If you are up for a challenge, we included a few ways you can add other features to the
extension.
